## Key Business Rules

- **No payments.** Enquiry-only. WhatsApp + email are the conversion channels.
- **No Indian domestic buyers.** All copy and UX targets international B2B buyers.
- **Quote Cart** replaces a shopping cart — buyers add products, fill trade details, submit.
- Every product page must show: MOQ, packaging options, certifications, origin.
- Brand positioning: premium, export-grade, internationally compliant — not a local spice shop.
